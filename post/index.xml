      <description>The days of winter stretch on long through the year,
fir soaking up the sun shone on the dells
though less now as we approach solstice.
The snow fell heavy last week,
dressing every branch and bough
Hugging the curves of the world, every curve in sight
Now its delicate undriven face falls away with the wind
its gaunt drifts revealing bones of ice</description>

      <description>Coming to you from nearly-nine-hundred lines of Emacs-lisp and a pittance of CSS. Do you really need more?Â 1 In time I&amp;rsquo;ll accumulate more bits and pieces of customization and configuration to apply, better expressing myself through this site. As it stands now this little veneer suffices, it&amp;rsquo;s never really about what&amp;rsquo;s on the cover anyway, but how effective the cover is at appealing to those that may appreciate the content.</description>

      <description>Intro This is getting pretty interesting. The spreadsheet functionality of org-tables is more impressive than I would have guessed. For small example here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of a diet.org file I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
* Food Lookup Table #+TBLNAME: nutrition | name | cal/g | fat%g | carb%g | prot%g | |----------------+-------+-------+--------+--------| | corn beef hash | 1.64 | 10 | 10 | 7 |  * Food Log #+TBLNAME: diet | timestamp | name | grams | cal/g | calories | |------------------------+----------------+-------+-------+----------| | [2021-01-15 Fri 13:35] | corn beef hash | 198 | 1.</description>
