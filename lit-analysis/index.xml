      <description>I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
 William Carlos Williams  A memory of a pleasant day, and remembrance that it is better to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission. Daring is refreshing, when tinted with humility.</description>
