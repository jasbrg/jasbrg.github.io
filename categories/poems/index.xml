      <description>I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
 William Carlos Williams  A memory of a pleasant day, and remembrance that it is better to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission. Daring is refreshing, when tinted with humility.</description>

      <description>The tree bough bowed low like dough, dipping slow into the lough
Slough off rough rock, fish roe were fisher&#39;s row tough talk
Though the rivers bend flows in boroughs, scoff not
Sough caught the soft eerie hertz that thrums through thought
Rapids slum tours, enough drought throughout we forgot the
River&#39;s mouth covered for a cough, now frothed in frosted draught</description>

      <description>The days of winter stretch on long through the year,
fir soaking up the sun shone on the dells
though less now as we approach solstice.
The snow fell heavy last week,
dressing every branch and bough
Hugging the curves of the world, every curve in sight
Now its delicate undriven face falls away with the wind
its gaunt drifts revealing bones of ice</description>
