      <description>Using randomness to solve problems that might be deterministic in principle. It is useful in circumstances when there is a simple test to verify if some solution is valid or invalid, many guesses are (uniformly) generated in the potential domain and their validity checked, then the proportion of valid guesses approximates to the solution.
Examples This is a single threaded approximation of the value of π. It can calculate a trillion guesses in around ten seconds, the multithreaded version on my four core ThinkPad performs the same amount of guesses in around five seconds.</description>

      <description>I have eaten
the plums
that were in
the icebox
and which
you were probably
saving
for breakfast
Forgive me
they were delicious
so sweet
and so cold
 William Carlos Williams  A memory of a pleasant day, and remembrance that it is better to ask for forgiveness than it is to ask for permission. Daring is refreshing, when tinted with humility.</description>

      <description>The tree bough bowed low like dough, dipping slow into the lough
Slough off rough rock, fish roe were fisher&#39;s row tough talk
Though the rivers bend flows in boroughs, scoff not
Sough caught the soft eerie hertz that thrums through thought
Rapids slum tours, enough drought throughout we forgot the
River&#39;s mouth covered for a cough, now frothed in frosted draught</description>

      <description>There are a few solutions for tracking bibliographies, the most prominent is Zotero but of course I&amp;rsquo;d like something to integrate into Emacs and Org mode. Luckily this problem has seen some man-hours, there is helm-bibtex and org-ref, and ebib, and pals. The former two are what I&amp;rsquo;ll use, I already use helm (half in preparation for using helm-bibtex) but I do wonder how it works all over. It&amp;rsquo;s already installed so let&amp;rsquo;s see how it works through ox-hugo: turing50:comput.</description>

      <description>The days of winter stretch on long through the year,
fir soaking up the sun shone on the dells
though less now as we approach solstice.
The snow fell heavy last week,
dressing every branch and bough
Hugging the curves of the world, every curve in sight
Now its delicate undriven face falls away with the wind
its gaunt drifts revealing bones of ice</description>

      <description>Coming to you from nearly-nine-hundred lines of Emacs-lisp and a pittance of CSS. Do you really need more? 1 In time I&amp;rsquo;ll accumulate more bits and pieces of customization and configuration to apply, better expressing myself through this site. As it stands now this little veneer suffices, it&amp;rsquo;s never really about what&amp;rsquo;s on the cover anyway, but how effective the cover is at appealing to those that may appreciate the content.</description>

      <description>Intro This is getting pretty interesting. The spreadsheet functionality of org-tables is more impressive than I would have guessed. For small example here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of a diet.org file I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on.
* Food Lookup Table #+TBLNAME: nutrition | name | cal/g | fat%g | carb%g | prot%g | |----------------+-------+-------+--------+--------| | corn beef hash | 1.64 | 10 | 10 | 7 |  * Food Log #+TBLNAME: diet | timestamp | name | grams | cal/g | calories | |------------------------+----------------+-------+-------+----------| | [2021-01-15 Fri 13:35] | corn beef hash | 198 | 1.</description>
